# Creating a Playbook with SOAR

## Objective


The Creating a Playbook Lab project aimed to use SOAR to automate alerts that would be handled by Limacharlie. Next,  a slack message would be sent as well as an email that would ask a security analyst if the machine should be isolated. Should the user say yes, the machine should be isolated and a notification sent via Slack. Should the user say no, a slack message should be sent saying more research is needed.

### Skills Learned


- How to implement Limacharlie into a SOAR platform
- Setting up slack notifications and sending an email when an alert event occurs.
- Automating system isolation based on user input.
- Understanding the workflow of a SOAR playbook
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used


- Security telemetry and endpoint monitoring platform (Limacharlie)
- SIEM Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (Tines)
- Communication Platform used for sending notifications (Slack)
